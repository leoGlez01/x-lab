One day I was having a conversation with a veterinarian friend and he told me that he had a problem, that he needed to use a platform to make compilations of fast files and that this would take a long time and other complications since the technology used in that platform is old. many years and it is very poorly optimized, so I started research on this field of bioinformatics and I promised my friend that I would make a fast, secure and accessible platform for all those medical professionals who need to use it.
